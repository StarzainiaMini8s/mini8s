# AS OF v0.3.98.1

Here will be the roadmap for Mini8s, going out with 1 patches and 1 major update into the future.
Shown here will be the planned features and patches for the next versions of Mini8s!

**v0.3.98.2**
- Port to Android
- Add alert tones for the program (made by Thodoris Demertzioglou) 3 for warnings, and 1 for watches. (Note: This will require a "list" of alerts the user is currently under to avoid it going off with every update)
- Further optimizations for lower end hardware (RPi oriented)
- EVEN MOAR OPTIMIZATIONS!!!

**v0.3.99**
- Add more LDL bars (for specific alerts)
- Add a city forecast for the users location (cities within 200km/125mi)
- Add an hourly forecast for the users location (temp, wind..)
- Add a "Radar + Wind (4 Hours)" for users under a Hurricane or Tropical Storm Warning (will give a wind and gust reading for the past 4 hours until present for areas within 200 km/125mi of the user)
- These two "forecasts" will be requested to the user if they want them or not upon startup. (y/n/yd/nd) "YD" will be "Yes, do not show this again". and "ND" will be "No, do not show this again"
- The Raspberry Pi 4 and machines akin to it will probably need a special edition for their weak hardware. (specific optimizations)
- Have Mini8s be *more* aware of what is going on in the users location. (reactive to tornado warnings, other stuff...)
