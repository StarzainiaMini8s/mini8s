# AS OF v0.3.98.2

Here will be the roadmap for Mini8s, going out with 1 patches and 1 major update into the future.
Shown here will be the planned features and patches for the next versions of Mini8s!

**v0.3.99**
- Add more LDL bars (for specific alerts)
- Add a hurricane/tropical cyclone overview that the user can see before loading into Mini8s proper (if they so request!)
- Add a city forecast for the users location (cities within 200km/125mi)
- Add an hourly forecast for the users location (temp, wind..)
- Add a "Radar + Wind (4 Hours)" for users under a Hurricane or Tropical Storm Warning (will give a wind and gust reading for the past 4 hours until present for areas within 200 km/125mi of the user)
- ^^^ These two "forecasts" will be requested to the user if they want them or not upon startup. (y/n/yd/nd) "YD" will be "Yes, do not show this again". and "ND" will be "No, do not show this again"
- The Raspberry Pi 4 and machines akin to it will probably need a special edition for their weak hardware. (specific optimizations)
- Have Mini8s be *more* aware of what is going on in the users location. (reactive to tornado warnings, other stuff...)

**v0.3.99.1**
- Further build on and optimize the features added in v0.3.99
- Revamp the location name system (more accurate to what people actually know)
- Graphics rework?
- A lot of what you see here will generally gauge on what happens in v0.3.99!
