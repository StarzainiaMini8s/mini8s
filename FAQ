# Mini8s FAQ:

> When will [VERSION] come out?
- Generally, patches and small QoL releases (v0.0.00.X) can be released within about a week or so of development.. I can generally get it out the door fast and can fix any known regressions found.
- On the other hand.. large updates (v0.0.0X.0) [v0.3.98.2 --> v0.3.99] will ALWAYS take usually a month or two to get ready, it almost always depends on the features that can be listed in the ROADMAP.md file.

> Will this be ported to Rust?
- Not until it is battle tested. NO. (plus, what kind of local FOSS weather app needs le heckin' chungus wholesome memory safety?)

> Will this be ported to [LANGUAGE OTHER THAN RUST]
- I'm uncertain on porting this to any other language at all, while yes, porting this to something near-ASM code (C or whatever) would provide a substantial performance uplift, I am not ready to undergo such an endeavor, nor am willing to spend months learning a new language right now. This is a project I do in my free time!

> Will Mini8s have theming?
- I'm hesitant on adding some sort of theming system for one good reason: Most of what you see with Mini8s is modular/pre-rendered vector images. If you feel the need to change the theme, it's right there in the binary or source code you've downloaded!

> Why CC0? (public domain)
- I personally do not believe in copyright/intellectual property on a moral and logical basis. This code can inherently be copied a million times, and is infinite. I refuse to coerce anyone if they choose to fork my code without my "offical permission", but asking me to fork would be great! (I could help!)

> What were the versions before the current one? 
- I have recently released a giant blob of source code .zip files containg every version from v0.3.21 to v0.3.97.1! 

> What is RedMode?
- RedMode is a feature that will activate in a Hurricane alert or Tornado Watch/Warning!

> How do I get the source code? 
- Download it straight from the green [<> Code ^] bubble!

> Can I fork this?
- Just ask! No copyright/license attatched!
